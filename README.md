## Score Keep Meteor app

In order to explore Meteor and get familiar with its eco-system, I build this project. The requirement was to create a database that records players and tracks their score. On the front-end, players can be added and removed and their score increased and decreased. Animations are added using the React Flip Move library. Once completed, the app was deployed to Heroku with the help of the meteor horse build pack.

<b>NOTE:</b> this app is not production ready as data is made available throughout the app. To change this add publications and subscriptions and meteor methods.

### Do you have a live example of this app?
I sure do! To see it in action on Heroku, click [here](https://score-keep11.herokuapp.com).

### So, how do I run this locally? I want to play around!
1. Clone or download this repo *
2. Open the folder in your terminal
3. type `meteor run`
